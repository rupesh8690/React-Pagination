# React-Pagination

Pagination in React is a technique used to divide a large dataset into smaller, manageable pages or sections, so only a subset of data is displayed at a time. This helps in improving user experience and performance by reducing the load on the UI and the browser, as it doesn't have to render all the data at once.
